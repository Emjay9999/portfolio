                This is a simple blog site with an API written using the Django
                Rest Framework and the frontend is written in ReactJs. The Data
                Base used for testign is SQLite3 but it is possible to use it
                with any database because of how good the django
                <span style="font-weight: 700">ORM</span> is. The site allowed
                any account holder to register/sign in and read as well as post
                their own blogs. One of the first react projects I ever build.

                This is a simple recipe app written in Django, Django Template
                and CSS. It is probably one of the first times I build a sort of
                full-stack application. It was responsive and dynamic. It even
                used a WYSIWYG editor for the recipe content. This of-course was
                easy to work with considering that django has a built in admin
                panel and that meant I didnt have to build that from scratch.

                This was my first Django Application. Wasnt too hard but it was
                a good project to learn how to so a lot of the things I know now
                about Django as a framework. It is a platfrom where users can
                keep track of their progress as they learn new things. Each user
                had their own learning log with topics, with each topic having
                mulitiple entries.

                This is a simple marketplace plattform. Just like all the other
                platforms, this one allows people to buy and sell commodities
                online. It is written in Django, Django Template and CSS. It was
                quite fun learning to build this platform because now I can do
                it again and again. It was a good learning experience.

                This is the first rest-full API I ever built using express. It
                taught me a lot and provided the basis for a bunch of other
                project I have build since then. It was a simple to-do list API
                written in express. It was supposed to be my learning project.
                Through this I learned to build more complex and more powerfull
                APIs.

                This is the project I am currently working on. It is an online

                actions are limited based of whether they have an account or
                not. The frontend is written in React though I might re-write it
                using typescript for type-safety. The backend is a rest-full API
                written in express and there is also a staff console app also
                written in react-TypeScript.
